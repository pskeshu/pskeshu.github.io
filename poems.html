                In the race to make things,<br>
                made many have we;<br>
                what use is a few,<br>
                when there is plenty.<br><br>

                Context matters always,<br>
                unsure are the ways;<br>
                what we have, we don't understand,<br>
                run around in circles do we.<br><br>

                Where do we go from here,<br>
                and where do we come from?<br>
                You're looking here and there,<br>
                yet what you seek is within you,<br><br>

                A tree starts as a seed,<br>
                grows into a plant,<br>
                twists and twirls<br>
                to find the sun.<br><br>

                Until one day,<br>
                the tree asks self,<br>
                why do I exist, if<br>
                I cannot even run.<br><br>

                Passersby listened to the worries<br>
                felt sad, and gave a shoulder to cry.<br>
                Oh giant tree, you must exist,<br>
                for you provide shade in the sun.<br><br>

                Unconvinced, the tree asked,<br>
                what use of I, if<br>
                fruits are not bourn by me.

                Despite all the trials,<br>
                tribulations and temptations<br>
                I refuse to die.<br>
                To die is to say,<br>
                there is no hope.<br>
                And to say there is no hope,<br>
                Is an insult to god.<br>
                Not to the god of the gaps,<br>
                But That that keeps the world going.<br>
                That that sparks life. The Chance.<br>
                That Encounter. That Miracle.<br>
                Of Life.
