<h2>1. In search of</h2>

<p>In the race to make things,<br />
made many have we;<br />
what use is a few,<br />
when there is plenty.</p>

<p>Context matters always,<br />
unsure are the ways;<br />
what we have, we don&#39;t understand,<br />
run around in circles do we.</p>

<p>Where do we go from here,<br />
and where do we come from?<br />
You&#39;re looking here and there,<br />
yet what you seek is within you,</p>

<p>says the hippie.</p>

<h2>2. fruitless existence</h2>

<p>A tree starts as a seed,<br />
grows into a plant,<br />
twists and twirls<br />
to find the sun.</p>

<p>Until one day,<br />
the tree asks self,<br />
why do I exist, if<br />
I cannot even run.</p>

<p>Passersby listened to the worries<br />
felt sad, and gave a shoulder to cry.<br />
Oh giant tree, you must exist,<br />
for you provide shade in the sun.</p>

<p>Unconvinced, the tree asked,<br />
what use of I, if<br />
fruits are not bourn by me.</p>

<p>A poem I wrote keeping in mind the sense of fruitless existence coming out of the existential crisis in research.</p>
