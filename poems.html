<h2>In search of</h2>

<p>In the race to make things,<br />
made many have we;<br />
what use is a few,<br />
when there is plenty.</p>

<p>Context matters always,<br />
unsure are the ways;<br />
what we have, we don&#39;t understand,<br />
run around in circles do we.</p>

<p>Where do we go from here,<br />
and where do we come from?<br />
You&#39;re looking here and there,<br />
yet what you seek is within you,</p>

<p>says the hippie.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>A poem I wrote with the raw emotions of working on a new project.</p>
