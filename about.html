                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a fundamental researcher with formal training in cell biology, biophysics, and fluorescence microscopy methods, complemented by extensive experience in software development, systems design, instrumentation and integration. My work is driven by a keen interest in the philosophy of science and a commitment to solving problems that act as barriers in understanding living entities, primarily at the cellular level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My approach spans multiple domains of modern science—from philosophy to cell biology, advanced imaging methods, software development, and AI. This interdisciplinary foundation has positioned me uniquely toward my goal of automating and unleashing machine understanding of living things. I focus on technological challenges across hardware, software, wetware, and conceptual frameworks that limit our comprehension of biological systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this broad perspective, I investigate how different forms of intelligence—human intuition, biological self-organization, and computational analysis—can be integrated to bridge the gap between raw microscopy data and meaningful biological insights.

                <h2>Current Focus</h2>
                <p>
                    I am developing methods based on my framework of microscopy-based understanding of cells, creating software that connects imaging to insight generation processes. My work involves mimicking various aspects of human scientific cognition in code, with the hope of enabling the emergence of machine scientific cognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach treats the process of observation and understanding as a collaborative effort between human expertise, biological complexity, and technological capabilities. By developing systems that can replicate and enhance scientific reasoning, I aim to transform how we extract knowledge from microscopic observations of living systems.
