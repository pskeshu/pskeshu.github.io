            <h2>The Person</h2>
            <p>I grew up curious about how things work, with a thirst for knowledge&mdash;consuming National Geographic and Discovery Channel from the small town of Rajapalayam in Tamil Nadu in the late 90s and early 2000s. I was drawn to computers early, writing code in Turtle in first grade, installing Linux at fifteen, teaching myself C, Python, Perl, and bash scripting. Science offered a path to pursue the questions that didn't have easy answers. Cell biology, specifically, because cells are complete living systems small enough to observe yet complex enough to never fully understand.</p>

            <p>My approach has always been to build what I need. When existing tools couldn't answer my questions, I learned to make new ones. This habit turned a PhD in cell biology into a parallel education in software engineering, instrumentation, and eventually philosophy of science. I find the boundaries between disciplines more interesting than their centers, and take special interest in bridging them and developing shared language.</p>

            <p>Outside the lab, I practice Iyengar yoga and Vipassana meditation&mdash;an exploration of the self, consciousness, and the deeper truths of the universe, which I hope to bring back to science. My yoga journey began in Rishikesh with Ekta Ghale and Usha Devi, and continues in Pondicherry with Bidhyadhar Kar. This too is part of bridging disciplines&mdash;trying to bridge the subjective experience of science with its objective language&mdash;exploring boundaries, and following where my instincts take me. I am also learning to sing Carnatic music, play chess, and sometimes write <a href="poems.html">poems</a> about the experience of research.</p>
