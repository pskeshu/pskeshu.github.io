<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Personal Statement</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a cell biologist with a special interest in developing &ldquo;smart&rdquo; microscopic methods that can be used in different biological contexts to access reliable statistics. In addition to the mean, such methods yield insight into population-level heterogeneity of a variety of cellular responses. The first part of my doctoral studies focused on developing fluorescence anisotropy imaging to monitor changes to chromatin compaction states with DNA damage in living cells. Live cell dynamics could be correlated to fixed cell immunofluorescence, identifying spatiotemporal relationships between chromatin and processes of DNA repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the above experiments, I found manual control of microscopy, which can be both labour-intensive and prone to human error, to be majorly limiting in terms of obtaining reliable statistics, especially for live cell dynamics. Thus, towards the end of my PhD, my interest shifted towards developing a software platform to perform large-scale automatic imaging experiments, both in terms of acquisition and online analysis, without human intervention. Reliable limiting histograms were obtained and rare subpopulations were identified in such &ldquo;high N&rdquo; investigations of DNA damage responses. These were proof-of-concept examples, and this tool is open-source and can be customized to the needs of a specific experiment, and can yield high throughput datasets from regular motorized widefield microscopes that are comparable to High Content Screening systems, thus making such large statistics investigations more widely accessible. Such was my excitement about these approaches, that I even founded a research company, NDimensional Systems, to make such tools widely available. This was a valuable lesson in entrepreneurship for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the future, I aim to develop hardware and software automation technologies to perform microscopic investigations at high throughput without any human intervention, thus yielding scientific understanding in a wide variety of biological contexts.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong><strong>Title: Microscopy and image analysis based enhancements for investigating DNA damage responses in cells</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description: </strong>Cells are constantly undergoing DNA damage, which is repaired by a system of proteins which work within the context of chromatin. I addressed how chromatin is remodelled upon damage to the underlying DNA by modifying a commercial widefield fluorescence microscope extensively and further developed a host of open-source libraries to automate large parts of imaging in general.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title: Characterizing the biochemistry of DNA Helicase UvrD from </strong><strong><em>Neisseria gonorrhoea&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description</strong>: UvrD a DNA Helicase from <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae. </em>It is an important protein that when deleted from the genome, increases the virulence of the pathogen. However, there is not much information on this protein. During my time in the lab, my research involved purifying and characterizing the UvrD DNA Helicase.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Title</strong>: <strong>Rapid Drug Sensitivity Testing for </strong><strong><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em></strong><strong> using Luciferase Reporter Phages&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description</strong>: Tuberculosis is a slow-growing organism that makes traditional drug sensitivity testing (DST) assays more time-consuming. It takes up to a month to use the classical techniques which delay the proper treatment of a patient with TB-like symptoms. Using lysogenic bacteriophages that have Luciferase Reporter genes, DST results can be obtained in as few as two days.</p>
