        <h1>P.S. Kesavan</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Fundamental Researcher in Cell Biology and Microscopy</p>

        <p class="thesis">I began as a cell biologist, studying how cells repair their damaged DNA. The need to see more clearly led me to build microscopy instruments and software. The desire to see more systematically led me to automation. And automation led to a deeper question: what would it mean for a machine to truly understand a living cell?</p>

        <p class="current">Currently based in Pondicherry, studying Iyengar yoga while collaborating remotely on next-generation microscopy systems.</p>
